    <h1>Why does this ebook exist?
</h1>
    <p>One Wednesday afternoon, </p>
      
     <p>An artist reached out to us, and we arranged to meet at a rooftop restaurant in the city.</p>
      
   <p>As we sat across from each other, he began to share his story.</p>

   <p>He had been making music for four years straight writing, recording, releasing, and doing everything he thought an artist was supposed to do, four years of dropping songs, four years of trial and error, four years of figuring things out on his own.
    
    <span class="highlightfindout"> Yet despite all the effort, his results were painfully discouraging.</span>
    
    <p>His page had barely 1000 streams, just 531 followers, and every post seemed to vanish into the void with zero engagement.</p>
    
    <p>At one point, he paused as the waitress came by. and  we ordered our meal and she walked away, he looked down at the table and asked the question that weighed heavy on him.</p>

    <p>"I’ve been making music for four years dropping songs, putting everything into this. Why isn’t it working? My music is just as good, if not better, than the stuff that’s blowing up right now. What am I doing wrong? What are they doing that I’m not?"</p>
    
    <p>His frustration was real. And the truth is he’s not alone. </p>

    <h1>There are countless artists like him. </h1>
    <p>Talented. </p>
    <p>Dedicated. </p>
    <p>Pouring their hearts into every track</p>
    <p>convinced that the music alone should be enough to carry them to success. </p>
    <p>But still, nothing clicks. <span class="highlightfindout">Not because their music isn’t good but because they don’t understand about personal branding.</span></p>
    <p>Think about it.</p>
    <h1>Most artists spend years perfecting their craft but still struggle to gain recognition. </h1> 
    <p>today’s world, talent alone isn’t enough. The artists who rise to the top aren’t always the most skilled they’re the most visible, the most memorable, and the most influential.
<p>What do artists like Sabrina Carpenter, Tyler, the Creator, and Billie Eilish have in common?
    <span class="highlightfindout">They are masters of personal branding.</span>
    <p>They have built identities so strong that you can recognize them the moment you hear their name, see a single photo, or even a specific color.</p> 
    <p>That’s the power of branding it makes you unforgettable.</p>  
    <p>And here’s the secret: personal branding isn’t just for celebrities. Whether you’re a rising musician with zero followers or an artist who’s been grinding for years, your brand matters more than ever. </p> 
    <p>About you sends a message your hairstyle, your visuals, your tone of voice, even the values you express.
    <span class="highlightfindout"> If you don’t craft that message intentionally, the world will do it for you.</span></p>
    <p>And that’s why we created this eBook for underrated and undiscovered artists who are ready to finally stand out.  </p>

    <h1>If you don’t have a strategy you have already failed </h1>
    <p>Then this might be the most important message you’ll ever read.

Here’s why:

My name’s Sabri Suby.

AKA “Internet Daddy” (more on that later)

And not too long ago, I was sitting in a rented bedroom with nothing but $50 to my name and an old computer my girlfriend (now wife) bought me.

No clients.

No agency. No clue how to grow a business predictably.  </p>

<p> So I did the only thing I knew how to do…

I picked up the phone and cold-called 150 strangers a day, 6 days a week — Most of whom told me to get lost, hang up, or worse.

But after locking myself away for 9 years. Working like a man possessed. And after hundreds of tests, late nights, and millions in ad spend…
<span class="highlightfindout">
I finally cracked the code.</span>

And went from cold-calling strangers from a rented bedroom.

To becoming a Shark on Shark Tank.

    <p class="inparagraph">
      <strong class="inheading">You will learn how to find your target audience :</strong>
       You will learn how to find your target audience by first looking at yourself—your story, values, and struggles. 
       Then, you’ll see who your fans are by checking social media, reading comments, running polls, and studying similar artists. 
        You’ll also learn their age, where they live, what they like, and how they find new music. 
        Knowing this helps you make music and content that feels made just for them and reach them where they spend the most time.
    </p>

    <p class="inparagraph"> <strong class="inheading">You will learn how to find your positioning strategy:</strong> You will learn how to find your unique place in the music world. 
      Brand positioning is about showing what makes you different from other artists—not just in your music, but in your story, values, and style. 
      This helps fans remember you, connect with you, and makes it easier to grow a loyal audience.</p>

    
    <p class="inparagraph"> <strong class="inheading">You will learn how to craft your messaging :</strong> You will learn how to create your brand message, which is the main idea about what you stand for and what makes your music special. 
      This message should be clear and shared everywhere—your music, website, and social media—so fans understand you and remember you.</p>

    <p class="inparagraph"> <strong class="inheading">You will learn how to craft your archetype :</strong> You will learn how to create your brand archetype, which is how people see you, your music, and your story. 
      This includes picking an archetype, like the wise guide, the rebel, or the fun friend, to give your brand a personality people connect with. 
      It helps you build trust and makes your brand unforgettable.</p>

    
    <p class="inparagraph"> <strong class="inheading">You will learn how to figure out what you want to be known for:</strong> You will learn how to figure out what you want to be known for. It’s called IKIGAI, a Japanese idea that says your purpose comes from four things: 
      what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can get paid for. 
      For example, if you love being creative and sharing knowledge, you can become a content creator and get paid to do what you’re good at.</p>

    <p class="inparagraph"> <strong class="inheading">You will learn how to figure out what you want to be known for:</strong>You will learn how to find your unique selling point, or USP, 
      which is what makes you different from others. It comes from what people need and what you do really well. 
      Your USP helps you stand out, be remembered, and attract the right fans.</p>

      
    <p class="inparagraph"> <strong class="inheading">You will learn how to face your fears:</strong>You will learn how to face your fears so you can build your personal brand. 
      Everyone worries about failure, judgment, or being seen online, 
      but the only way to grow and succeed is to take action. Start small, share your talent, 
      and make brave choices—your creativity is needed, and each step brings you closer to your dream.</p>

No agency. No clue how to grow a business predictably.  </p>
