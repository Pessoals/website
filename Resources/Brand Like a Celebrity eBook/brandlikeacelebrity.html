    <h1>Why does this ebook exist?
</h1>
    <p>One Wednesday afternoon, </p>
      
     <p>An artist reached out to us, and we arranged to meet at a rooftop restaurant in the city.</p>
      
   <p>As we sat across from each other, he began to share his story.</p>

   <p>He had been making music for four years straight writing, recording, releasing, and doing everything he thought an artist was supposed to do, four years of dropping songs, four years of trial and error, four years of figuring things out on his own.
    
    <span class="highlightfindout"> Yet despite all the effort, his results were painfully discouraging.</span>
    
    <p>His page had barely 1000 streams, just 531 followers, and every post seemed to vanish into the void with zero engagement.</p>
    
    <p>At one point, he paused as the waitress came by. and  we ordered our meal and she walked away, he looked down at the table and asked the question that weighed heavy on him.</p>

    <p>"I’ve been making music for four years dropping songs, putting everything into this. Why isn’t it working? My music is just as good, if not better, than the stuff that’s blowing up right now. What am I doing wrong? What are they doing that I’m not?"</p>
    
    <p>His frustration was real. And the truth is he’s not alone. </p>

    <h1>There are countless artists like him. </h1>
    <p>Talented. </p>
    <p>Dedicated. </p>
    <p>Pouring their hearts into every track</p>
    <p>convinced that the music alone should be enough to carry them to success. </p>
    <p>But still, nothing clicks. <span class="highlightfindout">Not because their music isn’t good but because they don’t understand about personal branding.</span></p>
    <p>Think about it.</p>
    <h1>Most artists spend years perfecting their craft but still struggle to gain recognition. </h1> 
    <p>today’s world, talent alone isn’t enough. The artists who rise to the top aren’t always the most skilled they’re the most visible, the most memorable, and the most influential.
<p>What do artists like Sabrina Carpenter, Tyler, the Creator, and Billie Eilish have in common?
    <span class="highlightfindout">They are masters of personal branding.</span>
    <p>They have built identities so strong that you can recognize them the moment you hear their name, see a single photo, or even a specific color.</p> 
    <p>That’s the power of branding it makes you unforgettable.</p>  
    <p>And here’s the secret: personal branding isn’t just for celebrities. Whether you’re a rising musician with zero followers or an artist who’s been grinding for years, your brand matters more than ever. </p> 
    <p>About you sends a message your hairstyle, your visuals, your tone of voice, even the values you express.
    <span class="highlightfindout"> If you don’t craft that message intentionally, the world will do it for you.</span></p>

    <h1>If you don’t have a strategy you have already failed </h1>
    <p>Then this might be the most important message you’ll ever read.

Here’s why:

My name’s Sabri Suby.

AKA “Internet Daddy” (more on that later)

And not too long ago, I was sitting in a rented bedroom with nothing but $50 to my name and an old computer my girlfriend (now wife) bought me.

No clients.

No agency. No clue how to grow a business predictably.  </p>

<p> So I did the only thing I knew how to do…

I picked up the phone and cold-called 150 strangers a day, 6 days a week — Most of whom told me to get lost, hang up, or worse.

But after locking myself away for 9 years. Working like a man possessed. And after hundreds of tests, late nights, and millions in ad spend…
<span class="highlightfindout">
I finally cracked the code.</span>

And went from cold-calling strangers from a rented bedroom.

To becoming a Shark on Shark Tank.

  <div class="text-contentsales">

    <p class="inparagraph">
      <strong class="inheading">
        If you’re relying on traditional marketing tactics </strong> such as social media ads and press coverage, to promote yourself as a musician? you’re on the right track.

      <strong class="inheading">Every artist’s journey is marked by distinct periods or eras </strong>  moments in time when their style, focus, or creative voice takes on a new shape. While your overarching story the essence of who you are and what you stand for remains consistent, the way you present yourself can evolve, grow, and transform.   Consider some iconic for examples like The Beatles: Their Psychedelic Era, including albums like Revolver and Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, saw the band experimenting with sound, visuals, and storytelling.

       and help ensure that every piece of content contributes meaningfully to the larger story you’re telling. Think of content buckets as different chapters of your campaign, each exploring a unique angle while remaining connected to the same narrative universe. For example, an artist who identifies with the “Explorer” archetype might share travel stories, performances in unusual locations, or cultural experiences, giving fans a sense of adventure and discovery. Meanwhile, a “Rebel” archetype could focus on stories of rising from humble beginnings, high-energy performance clips, DIY aesthetics, or underground pop-ups, all of which convey authenticity and raw creative energy.
